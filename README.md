# OVERVIEW
We will cover the basics of microcontroller programming, focusing on the Arduino platform. Arduino code can also be run on other microcontrollers, such as Teensy.

We will cover the 10 projects found in the Arduino Starter Kit. There is good reference materials for these projects and they cover a nice range of topics and programming concepts.

Each session combines three skills:
Connecting a basic circuit with the microcontroller
Writing code that interacts with the circuit
Analysing and understanding existing Arduino code

After completing the projects, you’ll be able to: 
Program different sensors and control software with them (using a serial port)
Control hardware, such as LCD displays
Write code that is easy to read and understand
Use and understand code written by other people
Debug code and troubleshoot hardware issues

Before each session, you should assemble the circuit for the project we are working on. We want to focus on learning programming and solving problems!
